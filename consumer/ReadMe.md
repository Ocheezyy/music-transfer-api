# Music Transfer Consumer
This is a go application to consume messages fromt he RabbitMQ queue. It will handle all queues from the `music-transfer-api`

## TODO: 
- Create models/types for incoming objects
- Look into if hitting API or direct database connections are better
- Dockerize
- Create unit tests
